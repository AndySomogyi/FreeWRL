Volumee Rendering aka voxels
http://www.web3d.org/documents/specifications/19775-1/V3.3/Part01/components/volume.html

Before starting to implement this there are a few other nodes and components that might be needed:
- clipPlane - besides transparent voxels, you may want to slice a volumetric image with a clipplane to look inside
- we have TextureProperties to get the RST
- Texturing3D component > for 3D image file format reading: 
	http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/volumetric/
	- Simplest 3d texture file, if you are writing your own
	http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Basic/VolumeRendering/
	- these examples use nrrd format, not much harder
Links:
	http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch39.html
	- GpuGems online, ideas about volume rendering
		- Note also http://teem.sourceforge.net/ link in References
		- same place as nrrd file format lib
	http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/compositing_shaders.php
	- in the "Compositing Shaders in X3D" .pdf, page 9 mentions volume nodes
	- the VolumeRendering Component has 10 style nodes, and Kambu is suggesting his Plug/hook method
	http://graphicsrunner.blogspot.ca/2009/01/volume-rendering-101.html
	- shows 'volume raycasting' method, shader (directx) and results
	http://cs.iupui.edu/~tuceryan/research/Microscopy/vis98.pdf
	- paper: "Image-Based Transfer Function Design for Data Exploration in Volume Visualization"
		pain: hard to stay organized with general functions in volume data
		solution: goal-directed composable steps ie sharpen surface, colorize via 'transfer functions'
		1. Apply transfer functions
			A. Gray = F(Gray) or F(F(F(F(Gray)))) ie can chain grayscale functions for each voxel processed
				a) F() image functions - anything from 2D image processing generalized to 3D
				b) F() spatial functions - edge sharpening ie sobel or smoothing also from image processing
			B. Gray to RGBA - lookup table
		2. do your raycasting on RGBA

	- uses webgl and x3dom

	- Uses teem
	http://teem.sourceforge.net/mite/opts.html
	- teem > Mite - has some transfer tables

	- shows volume raycasting shader example
