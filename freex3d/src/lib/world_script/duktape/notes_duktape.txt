If you refresh duktape from duktape.org in the future, what I found in 2017
a) they use python 2.7, and it needs PyYAML for 2.7 installed
b) they have a /tools folder
c) go in there and run python configure.py --help for details
d) I did a Generic build: python configure.py --output-directory=generic
-- and that means the duk_config.h has every possible compiler/platform detector in it
