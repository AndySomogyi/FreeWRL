Updated Feb 4, 2014
3 MSVC versions are currently used, in freewrl/freex3d/
- /projectfiles_vc9 (VS 2008) - used to build for windows XP (except ActiveX control)
--- XP uses glew/opengl32.dll/desktop-opengl, and directsound for sound/audio
--- and for windows developer(s) to check their code for linux gcc friendliness
- /projectfiles_vc12 (VS 2013) - builds for vista, win7, win8.1 desktop (except ActiveX control)
--- vista+ uses angleproject GLES2 (opengl-es-2.0) wrapper over directx for graphics, and directsound for sound/audio
- /projectfiles_vc7 (VS 2003) - used to build only ActiveX control
All are 32 bit builds, and run on 64 bit systems as win32 programs.

ACTIVEX CONTROL/PLUGIN NOTES:
To build the ActiveX project with a MS Visual C (MSVC) newer than 2003/vc7, 
edit the project parameters > linker and change any references to mfcs71.lib to 
mfcs??.lib where ?? is 90 for 2008/VC9 ie mfsc90.lib

The projectfiles_vc7/freewrlAx project is for the ActiveX control, which is the InternetExplorer plugin for freewrl. 
You need something more than the free express edition of Visual C++ to build it.
- there are special headers and dlls needed for ActiveX controls, that the express versions don't have.
The project initiator/current-maintainer dug9 had purchased a Visual C++ 2003 Standard Edition 12 years ago for $200.
-- that had the needed dlls and headers for ActiveX development, so that's what it's currently checked in with. 



When you build the freewrlAx project, it should 'register' the activex control in the system registry, 
as the handler for .x3d and .wrl file types and related MIME types model/x3d+xml model/vrml. 
OLD:
//A recent version of the freewrl_launcher 
//has a panel to control / reset what handles what in InternetExplorer, in case you have some other downloads
//handling .x3d and .wrl too.

(Launcher is a separate source download in SupportFiles at http://sourceforge.net/projects/freewrl/files/freewrl-win32/ 
or you can use the one that gets installed during binary .msi installation)
Then to test, you open an html file in internetExplorer that has an embed, object or href with a url.x3d/.wrl.


ABOUT THE LIBRARIES IN LIB_WINDOWS:
the .vcproj in projectfiles_vc7, _vc9 and _vc12 point to headers and .libs in lib_windows or lib_windows_vc12 folder
- you download the contents of these folders from http://sourceforge.net/projects/freewrl/files/freewrl-win32
Then if you git clone freewrl to your directory 'source' then put the lib_windows directories in 'source' too:
ie 
c:\source\freewrl ... source code as git cloned and checked out, or as you unzipped
c:\source\lib_windows  (for vc9)
c:\source\lib_windows_vc12

A few more that should be in your windows system already.
gdiplus.lib/.dll - .lib seems to be on my system somewhere, or:
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6a63ab9c-df12-4d41-933c-be590feaa05a&DisplayLang=en  GDI+ redistributable download - gdiplus.dll 2MB 
MSopenGL - found in my windows system directories opengl32.dll

OLD / UNDER REVIEW:
// And freewrlAx depends on libfreewrl built slightly differently than for the console program (but you can build it with MSVC express).
// To build the libfreewrl for the ActiveX control you need to change the following compiler settings:
// In libfreeWRL > Property Pages > Configuration Properties > C/C++ > Preprocessor > Preprocessor Definitions
// change the following:
// COMPILING_ACTIVEX_FRONTEND_no
// FRONTEND_HANDLES_DISPLAY_THREAD_no
// FRONTEND_GETS_FILES_no
// to:
// COMPILING_ACTIVEX_FRONTEND
// FRONTEND_HANDLES_DISPLAY_THREAD
// FRONTEND_GETS_FILES
// Then when building for everything else, change those back.
// Otherwise the regular freewrl will just exit without showing anything.
